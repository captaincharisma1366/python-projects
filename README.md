[**1. Dictionary**](dictionary)


This project, as the name suggests, is a simple dictionary program using a .json file([*data.json*](dictionary/data.json)) as the dictionary dataset.

The [*program*](dictionary/dictionary.py) allows the user to enter an input word, and fetches its meaning from the dataset. If the word does't exist, it returns 'Not found'. If the input is near enough to an existing word, then it asks the user whether they meant the existing word or not.
